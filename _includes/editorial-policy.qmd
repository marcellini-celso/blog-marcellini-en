**Rigor, beauty, and clarity.**  
The **courses** emphasize **Calculus** and **Statistics** because they are core foundations in undergraduate studies.  
**Articles and series** may address any topic in science, mathematics, statistics, computing, or technology.

No hermetic style “only for specialists”: advanced topics (e.g., differentiable manifolds, Lie groups, quantum field theory, general relativity) are presented with a **solid conceptual foundation**, in a **clear and thorough** manner.
