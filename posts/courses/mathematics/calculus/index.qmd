# 🧮 Welcome to the Course

::: callout-note
This course was designed to master **Limits, Derivatives, and Integrals** with **rigor**, **visualizations**, and **solved exercises**, integrating **LaTeX**, **Quarto**, **R**, and **Python**.
:::

::: callout-tip
**AP Tracks (Advanced Path).** Each module includes an **AP track** with more advanced topics that can be read later, without breaking the main flow.
:::

## 📘 Objectives
- Develop mathematical reasoning in limits, derivatives, and integrals;
- Present applications (Physics, Engineering, Economics, Computer Science);
- Explore problem solving with graphs and computational tools.

## 🧩 Quick Prerequisites {.unnumbered}
- Basic algebra: algebraic manipulation, inequalities, factorization;
- Notions of functions and Cartesian graphs;
- Comfort with mathematical notation (∑, ε–δ will appear in AP).

## 📚 Course Outline {.unnumbered}

- Physical applications *(in progress)*

## 🔹 Module 4 — Advanced Topics and Applications
- Differential equations *(in progress)*
- Taylor series *(in progress)*
- Modeling with calculus *(in progress)*
- Computational tools *(in progress)*
:::

## 🚀 How to Study
- Follow the suggested order. Read the **central idea** before the formal proof.
- Solve the **proposed exercises** and then check the **annotated solutions**.
- Run the **R/Python scripts** (folder `code/`) to explore the examples.
- Use the **AP topics** to deepen concepts without losing pace.

> **Code:** R and Python scripts are located in `posts/courses/mathematics/calculus/code/` and are included in the lessons.
>
> **Project standard:** graphs are generated by dedicated `.py`/`.R` scripts (outside the `.qmd`) to facilitate reuse and traceability.
