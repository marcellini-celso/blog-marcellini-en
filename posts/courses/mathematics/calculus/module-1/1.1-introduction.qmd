## ✨ What is Calculus?

### 🌱 Initial Intuition

Imagine a car on the road: the speedometer shows **how the speed is changing right now**; the total distance depends on **adding up small segments**.  
That is the spirit of calculus: **studying change and accumulation** in the real world.

### 📐 Mathematical Formulation (concise)

- **Change** → rates of variation (derivatives).  
- **Accumulation** → totals and areas (integrals).  
- **Limit** → the formal basis that gives precision to the “instantaneous” and the “continuous”.

## The Two Fundamental Problems of Calculus

### 🌱 Intuition: Tangents and Areas

1. **Tangent problem:** what is the slope of a curve at a point?  
2. **Area problem:** what is the area of a region bounded by curves?  

### 📐 Mathematical Formulation

- **Tangent** at \(A=(a,f(a))\): the slope of the tangent is the value towards which the **secants** converge when the second point approaches \(A\).  
- **Area** on \([a,b]\): the area under \(y=f(x)\) is the value towards which the **sums of small rectangles** converge as we refine the partition.

---

## 🔎 Visual Motivation — The Tangent Problem

We use the function \(y=e^x\) at the point \(A(0,1)\). In the figure, **secant lines** \((A–B, A–C, A–D)\) “rotate” until they become the **green line**, which represents the **tangent** at \(A\).

**Figure — Tangent approximation by secants for \(y=e^x\)**

![](../images/tangente.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

### 🧮 Mini Numerical Example (without limit notation)

For \(y=e^x\) at \(x=0\), consider the secant between \(x=0\) and \(x=h\).  
The slope of this secant is
\[
m(h)=\frac{e^{h}-e^{0}}{h}=\frac{e^{h}-1}{h}.
\]

Table (illustrative values):

| \(h\)   | Expression of \(m(h)\)               | Approx. value |
|:------:|:-------------------------------------|:-------------:|
| 1      | \(\dfrac{e-1}{1}\)                   | 1.7183        |
| 0.5    | \(\dfrac{e^{0.5}-1}{0.5}\)           | 1.2974        |
| 0.1    | \(\dfrac{e^{0.1}-1}{0.1}\)           | 1.0517        |
| 0.01   | \(\dfrac{e^{0.01}-1}{0.01}\)         | 1.0050        |

📌 Observation: the numerical values show that, **as \(h \to 0\), \(m(h)\) approaches 1**.  
Therefore, the slope of the **tangent line** to the graph of \(y=e^x\) at \(x=0\) is 1.

This is the **tangent problem**, one of the two fundamental problems of calculus.

## 🔎 Visual Motivation — The Area Problem (Method of Exhaustion)

Consider a **circle of radius 1**. We inscribe **regular polygons** with \(n\) sides.  
As \(n\) grows, the polygon’s area approaches the **area of the circle** — this is Archimedes’ **method of exhaustion**.

**Figure — Inscribed polygons approximating the area of the circle (R=1)**

![](../images/area_exaustao.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

### 🧮 Numerical Example (area of inscribed polygon)

For an \(n\)-sided polygon inscribed in the unit circle, the area is
\[
A_n=\frac{n}{2}\,\sin\!\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right).
\]

| \(n\) | \(A_n\)  | \(\pi - A_n\) |
|:----:|:--------:|:-------------:|
| 4    | 2.0000   | 1.1416        |
| 6    | 2.5981   | 0.5435        |
| 12   | 3.0000   | 0.1416        |
| 24   | 3.1058   | 0.0358        |
| 48   | 3.1326   | 0.0090        |
| 96   | 3.1394   | 0.0022        |

📌 **Reminder:** the area of a circle is given by \(\pi r^2\).  
For \(r=1\), the area is \(\pi \approx 3.1416\).  
Thus, the last column of the table shows how the difference \(\pi - A_n\) tends to zero as \(n\) increases.

This reasoning anticipates the **integral** as a tool to measure areas and accumulations — the **area problem**, the other fundamental problem of calculus.

## 📜 A Brief History of Calculus

- **Archimedes (3rd century BC):** method of **exhaustion** (areas and volumes) — seed of integral calculus.  
- **Fermat (17th century):** techniques for **tangents** — seed of differential calculus.  
- **Newton (1643–1727):** focused on motion and Physics; called derivatives *fluxions*.  
- **Leibniz (1646–1716):** clear and general notation (symbols we still use today).  

::: {.callout-tip title="Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (idea)"}
Later we will see that **change** (derivatives) and **accumulation** (integrals) are connected by a central result — the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** — which unifies the subject.

## ✅ Wrapping Up the Introduction

- Calculus answers two universal questions:  
  1) **How fast is something changing right now?** (tangents/derivatives)  
  2) **How much has accumulated over an interval?** (areas/integrals)  
- In this opening, we avoided formal symbols of limits/derivatives/integrals — focusing on **visual and historical intuition**.  
- Formalization will come step by step, always connected to **figures** and **numerical examples**.
