# 🎓📊 The Normal Distribution — Part 2

In this section, we focus on **standardization** (*z-score*), **reading the z-table**, and **applications** to compare performances, interpret probabilities, and prepare the ground for inference.

::: {.callout-note}
**📌 Objectives**
- Standardize \(X\) via \(Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\) and interpret the z-score.
- Obtain probabilities from the **z-table** and via software (R/Python).
- Compare performances across different scales using \(z\).
- Prepare for the use of percentiles and the **inverse normal**.

## 🧠 📖 Solved Exercises and Result Analysis

::: {.callout-note}
## 🧠 📖 Exercise 1 — Applying the z-Score

**Situation:** Suppose IQ scores follow a normal distribution with parameters:

- \(\mu = 100\) (mean)
- \(\sigma = 16\) (standard deviation)

**Question:** What is the probability that a person has an IQ **greater than 136**?

**Instructions:**
1. Compute the z-score corresponding to \(x=136\).
2. Use the **z-table** or software to determine \(P(Z>z)\).
3. Interpret the result: is this score **common** or **rare**?

💡 **Hint:**
\[
\boxed{\,z=\tfrac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\,},
\quad
\boxed{\,P(Z>z)=1-P(Z<z)\,}
\]
:::

::: {.callout-important collapse=true}
## 🧠 🔎 Solution — Exercise 1

**Distribution:** \(X \sim \mathcal N(100,\,16^2)\)

**🧮 Step 1 — z-Score**

\[
z = \frac{136-100}{16} = \frac{36}{16} = 2.25
\]

**🧮 Step 2 — Lookup in the z-table**

\[
P(Z<2.25) \approx 0.9878
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
P(Z>2.25) = 1 - 0.9878 = 0.0122
\]

**📌 Conclusion**

Only about **\(\mathbf{1.22\%}\)** of the population has an IQ above 136.
That is, it is a **rare** result, typical of individuals in the upper tail of the distribution.

## 📏 Comparing Performances with the z-Score

**Initial situation:**

- Student A scored 80 on a test with \(\mu=70,\; \sigma=5\).
- Student B scored 8 on a test with \(\mu=6,\; \sigma=1\).

**Calculation of z-scores:**

\[
z_A = \frac{80-70}{5} = 2.0
\qquad
z_B = \frac{8-6}{1} = 2.0
\]

**📌 Conclusion:**
Both students performed **2 standard deviations above the mean** of their classes.
In other words, their relative performance was **equivalent**.

## 🧠 📖 Exercise 2 — Comparing Performances with the z-Score

**Situation:**

- Student A scored 65 on a test with \(\mu=60,\; \sigma=4\).
- Student B scored 7 on a test with \(\mu=5.5,\; \sigma=1\).

**Task:**
1. Calculate the z-score for both students.
2. Compare the values.
3. Interpret: which one stood out more relative to their class average?

💡 **Hint:** the larger the \(z\), the better the relative performance.
:::

::: {.callout-important collapse=true}
## 🧠 🔎 Solution — Exercise 2

**Student A:**

\[
z_A = \frac{65-60}{4} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25
\]

**Student B:**

\[
z_B = \frac{7-5.5}{1} = \frac{1.5}{1} = 1.5
\]

**📌 Conclusion:**
Student B obtained \(z_B=1.5\), greater than \(z_A=1.25\).
Therefore, **Student B showed better relative performance** compared to their class.

## ✏️📄 Summary — Normal Distribution and z-Score

- **Normal Distribution:**

\[
\boxed{\, f(x)=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \, e^{-\tfrac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \,}
\]

- **Standard Normal Distribution (\(\mu=0,\; \sigma=1\)):**

\[
\boxed{\, f(z)=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \, e^{-z^2/2} \,}
\]

- **z-Score (standardization):**

\[
\boxed{\, z=\tfrac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \,}
\]

- **Original value from \(z\):**

\[
\boxed{\, x=\mu+z\sigma \,}
\]

- **Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7):**
  - \(68\%\): between \(\mu \pm 1\sigma\)
  - \(95\%\): between \(\mu \pm 2\sigma\)
  - \(99.7\%\): between \(\mu \pm 3\sigma\)

## 📊 z-Table — Standard Normal Distribution

**How to use the z-table:**
- The **row** gives the integer part and the first decimal place of the z-score.
- The **column** gives the second decimal place.
- The intersection provides \(P(Z<z)\), i.e., the cumulative probability up to \(z\).

| **z**  | 0.00   | 0.01   | 0.02   | 0.03   | 0.04   | 0.05       |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:----------:|
| 1.2    | 0.8849 | 0.8869 | 0.8888 | 0.8907 | 0.8925 | **0.8944** |

**🧠 Example:**
For \(z=1.25\), we use row **1.2** and column **0.05**, obtaining:
\[
P(Z<1.25)=0.8944
\]

::: {.callout-note}
## 💻 Practical Activities — Excel and R

**Objective:** apply the concepts of normal distribution and z-score in a computational environment.

**In Excel:**

- `=NORM.DIST(120,100,16,TRUE)` → computes \(P(X<120)\).
- `=NORM.INV(0.90,100,16)` → returns the value corresponding to the 90th percentile.
- Create a table with values of \(x\), compute z-scores, and highlight who is above the mean.

**In R:**

- `pnorm(120, mean=100, sd=16)` → returns \(P(X<120)\).
- `qnorm(0.90, mean=100, sd=16)` → returns the 90th percentile value.
- `z <- (x - mean)/sd` → computes z-scores of a vector.

💡 **Suggestion:** compare students from different classes (with different means and standard deviations) using the z-score.

## 🧠 📈 Challenge with Graph — Normal Distribution

**Situation:**
Service time (in minutes) in a facility follows \(X \sim \mathcal N(50, 10^2)\).

**Task:**

1. Mark on the graph the regions corresponding to:
   - \(P(40<X<60)\)
   - \(P(X>70)\)
2. Compute the z-scores corresponding to 40, 60, and 70.
3. Use Excel or R to calculate the probabilities of these regions.
4. Interpret: are these service times common or rare?

💡 **Hint:** use the **empirical rule** and the symmetry of the curve as visual support.

::: {.small}
The curve shows the distribution \(X \sim \mathcal N(50, 10^2)\).
The shaded areas represent: **Blue:** \(P(40<X<60)\), **Red:** \(P(X>70)\).
:::

::: {.callout-important collapse=true}
## 🧠 🔎 Answer Key — Graph Challenge

**Distribution:** \(X \sim \mathcal N(50, 10^2)\)

1. **z-Scores:**
\[
z_{40} = \frac{40-50}{10} = -1,
\quad
z_{60} = \frac{60-50}{10} = 1,
\quad
z_{70} = \frac{70-50}{10} = 2
\]

2. **Probabilities:**
- \(P(40<X<60) = P(-1<Z<1) \approx 0.6826\)
- \(P(X>70) = P(Z>2) = 1-P(Z<2) \approx 0.0228\)

**📌 Interpretation:**
- About **\(\mathbf{68.26\%}\)** of service times last between 40 and 60 minutes.
- Only **\(\mathbf{2.28\%}\)** last more than 70 minutes → they are **rare**.
:::

::: {.callout-important collapse=true}
## 💻 Answer Key — Using Excel and R

**Distribution:** \(X \sim \mathcal N(50, 10^2)\)

**In Excel:**

- \(P(40<X<60)\):
  `=NORM.DIST(60,50,10,TRUE) - NORM.DIST(40,50,10,TRUE)`
  → \(\approx 0.6826\)
- \(P(X>70)\):
  `=1 - NORM.DIST(70,50,10,TRUE)`
  → \(\approx 0.0228\)

**In R:**

- \(P(40<X<60)\):
  `pnorm(60, mean=50, sd=10) - pnorm(40, mean=50, sd=10)`

- \(P(X>70)\):
  `1 - pnorm(70, mean=50, sd=10)`

**Approximate results:**
\(P(40<X<60) \approx 68.26\%\),
\(P(X>70) \approx 2.28\%\).

## Importance of the Normal Distribution in Statistics

- The normal distribution is more than just a pretty curve: it is fundamental in applied statistics.

- Many inferential methods rely on normality:

  - Hypothesis tests (z-test, t-test)
  - Construction of confidence intervals
  - Linear regression analysis
  - Approximations for sampling distributions

- Understanding the normal distribution is the first step toward mastering statistical inference!
