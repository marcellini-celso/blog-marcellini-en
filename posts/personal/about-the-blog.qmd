# 👋 About Me

::: {.callout-tip collapse=false icon='🌟'}
This blog was born from the desire to share ideas, experiences, and insights about science, mathematics, and programming with curious and engaged minds.
:::

My name is Celso Marcellini. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of São Paulo (IME-USP).  
This blog emerged from my wish to explore mathematics, statistics, physics, LaTeX, Quarto, and programming in an accessible and visual way.

::: {.callout-note icon="✍️" title="✍️ Author’s Reflection"}

I studied pure mathematics and have always been fascinated by the theory of relativity — both special and general.  
The mathematics underlying these physical theories is, to me, indescribably beautiful.

One of the most striking ideas I encountered was the concept of the **four-velocity vector** in four-dimensional spacetime.  
Understanding that a physical quantity like velocity can be represented as a vector in Minkowski space — with the quadratic sum of its components equal to $c^2$ — revealed something deeply profound.

When I realized that, for any massive body, the **norm of the four-velocity** is always $c$, I also understood this:  
if we are at rest, our spatial velocity is zero, and our temporal velocity is $c$;  
as we move through space, some of that “total velocity” is redirected into space, reducing our velocity in time.  
Yet the vector sum — under the pseudo-Euclidean metric — remains constant.  
This directly implies **time dilation**: we age less when we move.

Later, while studying general relativity, I discovered that spacetime is a **pseudo-Riemannian differentiable manifold**, with a metric that curves in response to mass and energy.  
Wheeler’s quote has stayed with me ever since:

> *“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.”*

To me, this synthesis is uniquely beautiful.

I am also fascinated by the idea that physics still seeks a **unified theory** — one that integrates general relativity with quantum mechanics.  
If we ever succeed in explaining the macro and the micro with a single coherent mathematical structure, that will undoubtedly be one of humanity’s greatest intellectual triumphs.

Finally, as a mathematician, I find the same beauty in the formal foundations of mathematics itself.  
The axiomatic way we develop theorems, structures, and theories demands elegance, consistency, and inevitability.  
It’s no coincidence that Hardy said **beauty is the first test**.  
That statement isn’t just philosophical — it’s a quiet criterion that guides us while we prove.

# 💡 About the Blog

This blog was built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a powerful tool for creating scientific documents and presentations with Markdown and LaTeX.

## Technologies used

- **Quarto**: to render `.qmd` files as HTML  
- **RevealJS**: for interactive presentations  
- **MathJax**: for mathematical notation  
- **AWS S3** or **GitHub Pages**: for static hosting  
- **TikZ + PNG**: for diagrams converted and embedded  
- **Bootstrap theme `cosmo`** + custom `styles.scss`

## General structure

- `index.qmd`: home page  
- `posts/*.qmd`: individual posts  
- `about-the-blog.qmd`: about the author and blog  
- `images/`: image directory  
- `_quarto.yml`: site configuration

## 🛠️ How This Project Works

### 📜 Active scripts

- `atualizar-ultimos-posts.sh`:  
  Generates the latest posts list based on date and stores it in a reusable chunk (e.g., `ultimos_posts.qmd`).

- `gerar_posts_json.py`:  
  Scans all `.qmd` files and extracts metadata (title, tags, path) to create `docs/posts.json`, used in tag and navigation scripts.

- `gerar_tags.py`:  
  Reads `posts.json` and generates `tags_freq.txt`, `tags.qmd`, and `lista_tags_gerada.html` with tag counts.

- `nuvem_tags.py`:  
  Creates the image `nuvem_tags.png` with a word cloud from tag frequency, used in the tag navigation post.

- `atualizar_tags.sh`:  
  Builds individual pages for each tag (`tags/*.qmd`), updates `tags.qmd` with links, and generates the tag cloud.

- `atualizar_tudo.sh`:  
  Runs all previous scripts in logical order (latest posts → JSON → tags → cloud), ensuring everything is up to date with a single command.
