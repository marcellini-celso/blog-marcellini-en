# 👋 About Me

::: {.callout-tip collapse=false icon='🌟'}
This blog was born from the desire to share ideas, experiences, and learning about science, mathematics, and programming with curious and interested people.
:::

My name is **Celso Marcellini**, I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics** from IME-USP.  
Here I explore **mathematics, statistics, physics, LaTeX, Quarto**, and **programming** in an **accessible** and **visual** way — with good typography, graphics, and reproducible code.

::: {.callout-note icon="🎨" title="🎨 Beauty as a Criterion (Hardy)"}
What drives me most is the **beauty of ideas** in pure mathematics and theoretical physics.  
I follow Hardy’s intuition — *“beauty is the first test”* — and try to show that beauty here is **conceptual**: natural definitions, concise proofs, and inevitable connections between topics.  
Typography and graphics are the **wrapping**; at the core lies the **elegance of the constructions**.

# 💡 About the Blog

::: {.callout-tip icon="🧮" title="🧮 Why Highlight Calculus and Statistics?"}
Because they are **mandatory and essential subjects** in most undergraduate courses.  
In this blog, this emphasis appears mainly in the **courses** — with tracks, solved examples, and visualizations to strengthen the foundation that supports the rest.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon="📚" title="📚 Editorial Scope"}
Beyond the courses, **articles and series** may address **any topic** in science, mathematics, statistics, computing, and technology.  
Editorial commitment: **rigor, beauty, and clarity**.  
There is no place here for **hermetic** presentations “only for specialists.”

Advanced subjects (for example, **differentiable manifolds**, **Lie groups**, **quantum field theory**, **general relativity**) **do appear** here — but always with a **clear depth** and a **solid conceptual foundation**.  
Superficial expositions often obscure what is, by itself, beautiful and natural; therefore, the idea is to build the **foundations** that support each concept.
:::

This site was built with **[Quarto](https://quarto.org)**, a tool for creating scientific documents, reports, and static websites using Markdown and LaTeX.

## Technologies Used

- **Quarto**: rendering `.qmd` files into HTML  
- **RevealJS**: interactive presentations  
- **MathJax**: mathematical formulas  
- **AWS S3** or **GitHub Pages**: static hosting  
- **TikZ (exported to PNG/SVG)**: diagrams  
- **Bootstrap theme `cosmo`** + custom `styles.scss`

## General Structure

- `index.qmd`: homepage  
- `posts/*.qmd`: individual posts  
- `posts/pessoal/sobre-o-blog.qmd`: this “About” page  
- `images/`: images  
- `_quarto.yml`: site configuration

## 🛠️ How This Project Works

### 📜 Active Scripts

- `atualizar-ultimos-posts.sh`  
  Generates the list of the most recent posts by date and saves it in a reusable block (e.g., `ultimos_posts.qmd`).

- `gerar_posts_json.py`  
  Scans all `.qmd` files and extracts metadata (title, tags, path) to generate `docs/posts.json`, used in tag pages and navigation.

- `gerar_tags.py`  
  Reads `posts.json` and generates `tags_freq.txt`, `tags.qmd`, and `lista_tags_gerada.html` with the frequency of each tag.

- `nuvem_tags.py`  
  Creates `nuvem_tags.png` (a word cloud with tag frequencies), displayed on the tags navigation page.

- `atualizar_tags.sh`  
  Creates individual pages for each tag (`tags/*.qmd`), updates `tags.qmd` with links, and regenerates the word cloud.

- `atualizar_tudo.sh`  
  Runs everything in order (latest posts → JSON → tags → word cloud), ensuring the site is updated with a single command.
