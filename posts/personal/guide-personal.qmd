## About this Guide

This space gathers reflections, notes, and paths I have been following in the study of Mathematics and related fields.  
The proposal is to share a **suggested reading order**, combining authorial texts and behind-the-scenes in a structured way — from introduction to deepening — always with conceptual rigor and accessible language.

---

## ✅ Suggested Order

1. **[📘 🧑‍🏫 About Me & About the Blog](about-the-blog.qmd)** — Ideal for new visitors to understand the project. It presents the purpose, structure, and a brief introduction of the author.

2. **[📘 ✨ Living as if Everything Were a Miracle](einstein.qmd)** — A reflection inspired by Einstein’s quotes and writings on wonder, education, justice, solitude, and ideals — revealing his human side beyond the brilliant physicist.  

📌 This guide is updated as new content is published.

## 📅 Coming Soon

A preview of upcoming texts planned for the Personal Blog:

- **How I study mathematics daily** — routine, readings, and notes.  
- **Tools I use** — Quarto, LaTeX, R/Python, and project organization.  
- **Behind the Blog** — publishing pipeline (folder structure, Git, deploy).  
- **Scientific design** — typographic choices, figures, and diagram standards.  
- **Editorial roadmap** — how I decide the sequence of posts and series.  

> When each text is published, it will automatically appear here and in the section index.
