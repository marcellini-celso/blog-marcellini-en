# 📘 👨‍💻 📄 index.qmd Templates for Quarto Projects

## Introduction

The `index.qmd` file is usually the **main entry point** of a Quarto project.  
It can be used as the **home page of a website or a book**, and its YAML header defines the global title, formatting, and other project settings.

Below are usage templates of `index.qmd` in different types of projects.
