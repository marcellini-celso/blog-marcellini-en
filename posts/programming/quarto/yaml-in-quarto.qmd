# 📘 👨‍💻 📄 YAML in Quarto: The Invisible Heart of Your Documents

## Introduction

YAML is the first thing that appears in a `.qmd` document — but for many, it’s also the most mysterious.

> In this post, we will understand:

> - What YAML is
> - How it works in `.qmd` files
> - Main fields used in Quarto projects
> - Practical examples of YAML headers

## What is YAML?

YAML stands for **“YAML Ain’t Markup Language”** — even though it looks like one.

It is a **human-readable** format used to declare configurations.  
It is simple, indented with **spaces** (not tabs), and uses **key:value pairs**.

---

## Minimal example


```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
author: "Blog do Marcellini"
format: html
---
```

---

## Where is YAML Used in Quarto?

At the **top of any `.qmd` file**, between `---` and `---`.

> YAML defines **how the document will be processed and rendered**: title, author, output format, code execution options, cover image, table of contents, and much more.

## Common YAML Fields in Quarto

| Field          | Description                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `title`        | Document title                                      |
| `author`       | Name of the author(s)                               |
| `date`         | Creation or publication date                        |
| `format`       | Output format: `html`, `pdf`, `epub`, `docx`        |
| `editor`       | Type of editor used (e.g., `visual`)                |
| `lang`         | Document language (e.g., `en-US`)                   |
| `cover-image`  | Cover used for EPUB or PDF                          |
| `toc`          | Shows the table of contents (`true` or `false`)     |
| `execute`      | Rules for code execution                            |

---

## Complete Example


```yaml
---
title: "Data Analysis with R"
author: "Blog do Marcellini"
date: 2025-06-23
format: html
lang: en-US
toc: true
execute:
  engine: knitr
  echo: true
  warning: false
  message: false
---
```

---

## Cautions When Using YAML

- ✅ **Use spaces, never TABs**.  
- ✅ Indentation must be **consistent**.  
- ✅ Lists are created with `- item`.  
- ✅ Long text blocks can use `|` (to keep line breaks) or `>` (to join lines).

---

## Conclusion

YAML may seem like just a technical block at the beginning of a `.qmd`, but it is the **soul of configuration** in Quarto.  
Mastering YAML is essential for customizing your documents, projects, websites, and books.
