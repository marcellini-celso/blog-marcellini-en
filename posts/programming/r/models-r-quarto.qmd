# 📘 👨‍💻 📄 📊 R Code Templates for Use with Quarto

## Introduction

Quarto allows the direct execution of R code blocks in `.qmd` files.  
This makes it possible to generate dynamic reports, plots, statistical analyses, and interactive visualizations, all integrated with text.

The snippet below is the **YAML header** of the `.qmd` document, which defines the title, author, date, output format, and execution options for R code:

## Simple R code block

```{r simple}
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
y
```

---

## Creating a base plot

```{r plot}
plot(x, y, type = "b", col = "blue", main = "Plot of x²", xlab = "x", ylab = "y = x²")
```

---

## Using ggplot2

```{r ggplot2}
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Plot with ggplot2", x = "x", y = "x²")
```

---

## Descriptive statistics

```{r summary}
summary(mtcars)
```

---

## Histogram

```{r hist}
hist(mtcars$mpg, col = "lightblue", main = "MPG Distribution", xlab = "Miles per gallon")
```

---

## Linear simple regression

```{r lm}
model <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
summary(model)
```

---

## Plot with regression line

```{r abline}
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg, pch = 19, col = "gray", main = "MPG vs HP")
abline(model, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

---

## Formated table with knitr::kable

```{r kable}
library(knitr)
kable(head(mtcars), caption = "First rows of the mtcars dataset")
```

---

## Conditional results with `if`

```{r if}
valor <- mean(mtcars$mpg)

if (valor > 20) {
  print("The average MPG is high.")
} else {
  print("The average MPG is low.")
}
```

---

## Conclusion

With Quarto and R, it is possible to integrate text, code, and results into a single dynamic and reproducible document.  
These templates are a starting point for creating statistical and scientific reports with a high professional standard.
