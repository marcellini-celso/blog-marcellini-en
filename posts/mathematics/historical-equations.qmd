# 📘 ✨ 🧮 ⚛️ Equations that Shaped History

Over the centuries, certain formulas have stood out for their beauty, depth, and impact. This section celebrates these jewels of mathematics and physics.

---

## 🧠 Euler’s Identity

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

Connects the five most fundamental numbers in mathematics: $e$, $i$, $\pi$, $1$, and $0$. Considered by many the most beautiful equation of all.

---

## 📡 The Wave Equation

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

Models vibrations in strings, sound, light, and other waves. Appears naturally in physics, engineering, and partial differential equations (PDEs).

---

## 🔢 Ramanujan’s Formula for $\frac{1}{\pi}$

$$
\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(4k)!\,(1103 + 26390k)}{(k!)^4\,396^{4k}}
$$

This series converges extremely quickly and has been used in modern high-precision algorithms to compute $\pi$. Discovered by Ramanujan through pure mathematical intuition.

---

## 🌌 Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

Describes the gravitational attraction between two massive bodies. Foundation of classical mechanics and astronomy.

---

## 🌊 Schrödinger’s Equation (Time-Independent Form)

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi = E \psi
$$

Fundamental equation of quantum mechanics. Determines the behavior of the wave function $\psi$ of a quantum particle.

---

## ⚡ Maxwell’s Equation for the Electric Field (Differential Form)

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

One of Maxwell’s four equations governing electromagnetism. This one describes how charges generate electric fields.
