# 🧭 🛰️ Reading Guide — Special Relativity Series

Organization of posts on Special Relativity: a didactic introduction and an academic deep dive.

## 🌟 Overview

If you are just starting or want a lighter, more contextual read, begin with the introductory post:

👉 **[📘 🛰️ Special Relativity: Einstein, Time, and the Speed of Light](special-relativity.qmd)**  
A visual, historical, and accessible introduction.

---

## 📚 Academic Deep Dive

Ready for a more technical read, with formulas, postulates, and conceptual analyses?

👉 **[📘 🛰️ The Theory of Special Relativity — A More Academic View](special-relativity-academics.qmd)**

Ideal for students and teachers who want a solid and structured foundation.
