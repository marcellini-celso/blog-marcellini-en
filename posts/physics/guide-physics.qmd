## About this guide

This guide provides a suggested reading order for those who want to study Physics in a structured way. It gathers the main content available in the section, organizing special series, articles, and reflections into a coherent path — from introduction to deepening.

## ✅ Suggested order

1. **[📘 🛰️ Special Relativity — An Overview](special-relativity.qmd)** — Didactic introduction to the concepts of spacetime, Lorentz transformations, and the twin paradox.

2. **[📘 🛰️ Special Relativity — An Academic View](special-relativity-academics.qmd)** — More formal and in-depth version of the theory of special relativity, based on classical sources (e.g., Resnick).

3. **[📘 🧬 100 Years of Quantum Mechanics](100-years-quantum-mechanics.qmd)** — Historical and conceptual introduction to the centennial of quantum theory.

4. **[🧭 🛰️ Reading Guide — Special Relativity](guide-special-relativity.qmd)** — Progressive reading path between the introductory and the academic versions.

5. **[🧭 🧬 Reading Guide — 100 Years of Quantum Mechanics](guide-100-years-quantum-mechanics.qmd)** — Deepening.  
   🔸 *Series in progress — Part 1 published.*

6. **[🧭 🌠 Reading Guide — General Relativity](guide-general-relativity.qmd)** — Overview.  
   🔸 *Series in progress — Part 1 published.*

📌 This guide is updated as new content is published.
