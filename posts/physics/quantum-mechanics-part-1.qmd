# üìö üß¨ Part 1 ‚Äî Before the Quantum Revolution (In-Depth)
Special series on the 100 years of Quantum Mechanics. Part 1: Before the Quantum Revolution.

## Before the Quantum Revolution

> *This post is part of the special series "100 Years of Quantum Mechanics".*

## Introduction

By the end of the 19th century, physics seemed complete. Newton‚Äôs equations accurately described the motion of bodies ‚Äî from the fall of an apple to the orbit of planets ‚Äî based on forces and accelerations. Classical dynamics was grounded in the **laws of motion**:

$$
\text{1st Law:} \quad \vec{F}_\text{net} = 0 \Rightarrow \vec{v} = \text{constant}
$$
$$
\text{2nd Law:} \quad \vec{F} = m \cdot \vec{a}
$$
$$
\text{3rd Law:} \quad \vec{F}_{AB} = -\vec{F}_{BA}
$$

And, especially, in the **law of universal gravitation**, which described the attraction between masses:

$$
F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

Meanwhile, James Clerk Maxwell had consolidated knowledge about electricity and magnetism into **Maxwell‚Äôs equations**, which describe how electric and magnetic fields interrelate and propagate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{(1) Gauss‚Äôs law for electricity:} && \nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \\
&\text{(2) Gauss‚Äôs law for magnetism:} && \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0 \\
&\text{(3) Faraday‚Äôs law:} && \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \\
&\text{(4) Amp√®re‚ÄìMaxwell law:} && \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}
\end{aligned}
$$

These equations not only explained electromagnetic phenomena but also predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, whose speed matched that of light. This led to the revolutionary interpretation that **light is an electromagnetic wave**.

The harmony between these laws ‚Äî Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell‚Äôs electromagnetism ‚Äî gave scientists of the time the feeling that the universe was completely understood.

In 1900, Lord Kelvin declared that **the foundations of physics were established**, with only **two small clouds on the horizon** ‚Äî referring to minor experimental discrepancies.

These ‚Äúclouds,‚Äù however, heralded a **theoretical storm** that would forever change our understanding of reality.

In a lecture at the Royal Institution on April 27, 1900, the British physicist **Lord Kelvin** stated that there were only ‚Äútwo small clouds on the horizon of physics‚Äù:

### ‚òÅÔ∏è First Cloud: Blackbody Radiation

> *‚ÄúThe failure of theory to explain the distribution of thermal radiation energy.‚Äù*

This was the problem we now call the **ultraviolet catastrophe**:

- The **Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law**, derived from classical physics, predicted that the energy radiated by a blackbody **increased indefinitely with frequency**.  
- **Experiments showed the opposite**: energy increases, reaches a peak, and then **decays at high frequencies**.  
- Kelvin realized this deviation was not trivial ‚Äî but **he did not imagine it would require abandoning the paradigm of continuous energy**.  
- This ‚Äúcloud‚Äù was dispelled by **Planck**, with his hypothesis of **energy quantization** (1900).  

üîÅ *This marks the origin of quantum mechanics.*

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Second Cloud: The Luminiferous Ether and Lorentz Transformation

> *‚ÄúThe inconsistency between Maxwell‚Äôs equations and the absence of ether detection.‚Äù*

- At the time, it was believed that **light required a medium to propagate**: the so-called **luminiferous ether**.  
- **Maxwell‚Äôs equations** predicted the speed of light $c$, but **did not make clear in which reference frame this velocity was valid**.  
- The **Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment (1887)** showed that **it was impossible to detect Earth‚Äôs motion relative to the ether**.  
- This cast doubt on all of **classical mechanics**, which relied on absolute reference frames.  
- The ‚Äúcloud‚Äù was only dispelled when **Einstein proposed the Special Theory of Relativity** (1905), eliminating the ether and postulating that **the speed of light is the same for all inertial frames**.  

üîÅ *This marks the origin of special relativity.*

## The Ultraviolet Catastrophe

By the end of the 19th century, one of the great challenges of theoretical physics was to understand how heated objects ‚Äî called **blackbodies** ‚Äî emit thermal radiation. A **blackbody** is an idealized object that absorbs all incident radiation and reemits energy depending only on its temperature.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" align="center"}
![Idealized model of a blackbody](../../images/cavidade-corpo-negro.png)

**Figure**: *Idealized model of a blackbody: a cavity with reflective inner walls and a small opening. Radiation entering through the opening undergoes multiple reflections inside the cavity, being almost completely absorbed. The radiation emitted through the slit accurately represents the blackbody spectrum. This model was fundamental for the experiments that led to the birth of quantum mechanics.*
:::

The problem was to accurately describe the distribution of energy emitted at different frequencies (or wavelengths). **Classical physics**, using electromagnetic theory and Boltzmann statistics, led to the so-called **Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law**, which predicted:

$$
E(\nu, T) \propto \nu^2 \cdot kT
$$

where:

- $\nu$ is the radiation frequency,  
- $k$ is Boltzmann‚Äôs constant,  
- $T$ is the temperature of the body.  

This expression works well for low frequencies (infrared), but presents a serious problem at high frequencies: it grows indefinitely as $\nu \to \infty$. This would imply that a blackbody emits infinite energy ‚Äî a physical absurdity.  

This impasse became known as the **ultraviolet catastrophe**. The term was coined because the error of classical theory became dramatic in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, where the predicted energy completely diverged from experimental observations.

---

### üî¨ Experimental Evidence vs. Classical Theory

Experiments with blackbody cavities showed a very different behavior. The emitted energy increased up to a certain point, reached a peak, and then **dropped sharply** at high frequencies. The observed curve looked like this:

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" align="center"}
![Graph of blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe](../../images/Black_body.svg)

**Figure**: *The ultraviolet catastrophe is the error of classical theory in predicting that blackbody radiation increases without bound at high frequencies. In the graph, the black curve shows this prediction (Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law), while the blue curve represents the actual data, correctly explained by Planck‚Äôs theory.*
:::

---

### üß† A Conceptual Crisis

This problem was not merely technical ‚Äî it was **conceptual**. If classical physics failed in something as fundamental as thermal radiation, perhaps its very foundations were incomplete. The solution would require abandoning the assumption of continuous energy.

This moment marked the beginning of a profound **revolution in physical thought**. In 1900, Max Planck dared a radical hypothesis: energy could only be emitted in discrete quantities, or *quanta*. This idea would give rise to the entire framework of quantum mechanics.

## Planck‚Äôs Quantization

In 1900, faced with the impasse of blackbody radiation, **Max Planck** proposed a revolutionary solution ‚Äî though he himself was not fully aware of the depth of his proposal. To fit the emission curve to experimental data, Planck introduced a radical hypothesis: **energy cannot be emitted continuously**, but only in discrete multiples of an elementary quantity.

This elementary amount of energy is proportional to the frequency of radiation:

$$
E = h \cdot \nu
$$

where:

- $E$ is the energy of the radiation quantum,  
- $\nu$ is the radiation frequency,  
- $h$ is **Planck‚Äôs constant**, introduced by him:  

  $$
  h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \ \text{J¬∑s}
  $$

Planck derived this formula by adjusting the distribution of energy emitted by a blackbody using statistical and thermodynamic principles. The new **Planck law** for the spectral energy density is:

$$
E(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \cdot \frac{1}{e^{h\nu / kT} - 1}
$$

This equation resolves both extremes:

- For low frequencies ($h\nu \ll kT$), it approaches the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans formula.  
- For high frequencies ($h\nu \gg kT$), the exponential term dominates, and the energy tends to zero, as observed experimentally.  

---

### üîç The Disguised Revolution

Curiously, Planck considered his proposal a ‚Äúmathematical trick.‚Äù He himself was skeptical about the idea that energy **was truly quantized in nature**. And yet, his formula worked ‚Äî with surprising precision.

Thus emerged the **first physical expression involving the constant $h$**, which would later become the universal symbol of quantum mechanics.

---

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" align="center"}
**Did you know?**  
Planck only adopted quantization as a last resort, since he had unsuccessfully tried to justify the data using classical methods. His initial hesitation is an example of how the greatest scientific revolutions sometimes arise reluctantly.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
### üî¨ Planck‚Äôs ‚ÄúMathematical Trick‚Äù ‚Äî The Discrete Revolution via Series

To solve the blackbody radiation crisis, Max Planck proposed in 1900 a bold hypothesis: the energy of the oscillators producing thermal radiation could only be emitted in **discrete quantities**, called **quanta**:

$$
E_n = n h \nu, \quad \text{with } n = 0, 1, 2, \dots
$$

---

### üß± Physical Model: Quantized Oscillators

Planck imagined that radiation was produced by **harmonic oscillators** ‚Äî small electric charges vibrating in the walls of the cavity. In classical physics, these oscillators could have any continuous energy. Planck, however, proposed:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The energy of each oscillator does not vary continuously, but only in integer multiples of an elementary amount $h \nu$.

> üí° **Note**: Planck modeled the constituents of the cavity as **classical harmonic oscillators** ‚Äî i.e., small electric charges vibrating under restoring forces (like electrons bound in atoms or molecules). These oscillators absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation, and their statistical energy distribution formed the basis for deriving the blackbody radiation formula. This idealization was consistent with the knowledge of the time and essential for introducing energy quantization.

---

### üìä Entropy and Boltzmann Statistics

::: {.callout-theorem appearance="simple"}
#### üìä The Formula $S = k \ln W$ and Planck‚Äôs Application

To derive his blackbody radiation formula, Max Planck used a key concept from statistical mechanics: the **relationship between entropy and the number of microstates**, proposed by Ludwig Boltzmann:

$$
S = k \ln W
$$

This equation relates:

- $S$: the **entropy** of a system ‚Äî a measure of disorder or of the number of microscopic possibilities for the same macroscopic state;

- $k$: **Boltzmann‚Äôs constant**, $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \ \text{J/K}$;

- $W$: the **number of possible microstates** ‚Äî that is, how many ways the energy quanta can be distributed among the system‚Äôs oscillators.

The logarithmic function ensures that entropy is **proportional to the system size**: doubling the number of microstates doubles $\ln W$, but does not directly multiply $W$.

---

### üß† How Did Planck Use This?

Planck assumed that energy was composed of discrete multiples of $h \nu$. He then calculated:

1. **How many ways $W$** there were to distribute $n$ energy quanta among $N$ oscillators;  
2. Applied Boltzmann‚Äôs relation to obtain the **entropy of the system**: $S = k \ln W$;  
3. Related entropy and temperature through the thermodynamic identity $\frac{dS}{dE} = \frac{1}{T}$;  
4. Finally obtained the **average energy** $\langle E \rangle$, which leads to the correct formula for thermal radiation.  

---

> This was the first time **statistics with quantized energy** was applied ‚Äî and the beginning of the transition from classical physics to quantum mechanics.
:::

The innovation lay in **how to count $W$**: assuming that the total energy was made up of $n$ quanta $h\nu$, he used **statistical combinatorics** to determine the average energy of the oscillators:

$$
\langle E \rangle = \frac{\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty E_n e^{-E_n / kT}}{\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty e^{-E_n / kT}} = \frac{\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty n h \nu \cdot e^{-n h \nu / kT}}{\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty e^{-n h \nu / kT}}
$$

With $x = e^{-h \nu / kT}$, this becomes:

$$
\langle E \rangle = h \nu \cdot \frac{\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty n x^n}{\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty x^n}
$$

Applying known geometric series:

- $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \frac{1}{1 - x}$  
- $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n x^n = \frac{x}{(1 - x)^2}$  

We obtain:

$$
\langle E \rangle = h \nu \cdot \frac{x}{1 - x} = \frac{h \nu}{e^{h \nu / kT} - 1}
$$

---

### üìà The Final Formula: Planck‚Äôs Law

By multiplying the average energy by the number of modes $\propto \nu^2$, Planck arrived at the **complete formula for blackbody radiation**:

$$
E(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \cdot \frac{1}{e^{h \nu / kT} - 1}
$$

This formula **fixes the divergence of the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law** and matches experimental data perfectly.

---

### üìå Summary of the ‚ÄúTrick‚Äù:

- **Hypothesis:** quantized energy $E = n h \nu$  
- **Calculation:** Boltzmann statistics with discrete counting  
- **Result:** correct average energy  
- **Conclusion:** blackbody radiation formula validated experimentally

*In the next section, we will see how Einstein took Planck‚Äôs idea seriously ‚Äî applying the quantization of light to explain the photoelectric effect ‚Äî and how this idea would become the foundation of the new physics.*


## The Photoelectric Effect and Einstein‚Äôs Photons

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" align="center"}

![Albert Einstein (1879‚Äì1955)](../../images/einstein.png)

Albert Einstein (1879‚Äì1955), the physicist who explained the photoelectric effect with the photon hypothesis, inaugurating a new era in physics.

:::

In 1905, Albert Einstein published a revolutionary paper entitled *‚ÄúOn a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light.‚Äù* In it, he proposed that light not only **behaves as a wave** but also as a **stream of discrete energy particles** ‚Äî the **light quanta**, today called **photons**.

For Einstein, Planck‚Äôs quantization was not just a mathematical device. It represented a **fundamental physical property** of electromagnetic radiation. The clearest empirical evidence of this came from an intriguing phenomenon: the **photoelectric effect**.

---

### ‚ö° What Is the Photoelectric Effect?

The photoelectric effect is the **emission of electrons from a metallic surface when it is illuminated by light of sufficiently high frequency**.

#### üîç Experimental observations:
- Electron emission **only occurs above a minimum frequency** $\nu_0$ ‚Äî called the **threshold frequency**.  
- The **intensity of the light** affects the **number** of electrons emitted, but **not** their **kinetic energy**.  
- The **energy of emitted electrons increases with the frequency of light**, not with its intensity.  

These results were **incompatible with classical wave theory**, which predicted that intense light (even at low frequency) could supply enough energy to release electrons ‚Äî which is not what experiments show.

---

### üí° Einstein‚Äôs Hypothesis: Light as Packets of Energy

Einstein proposed that light is made up of particles ‚Äî **photons** ‚Äî and that each photon carries a discrete amount of energy:

$$
E = h \nu
$$

When a photon strikes an electron on the metal surface:

- Part of the energy is used to overcome the material‚Äôs **work function**, denoted by $\phi$;  
- The remainder appears as the electron‚Äôs **kinetic energy $K$**.  

---

### üßÆ Einstein‚Äôs Photoelectric Equation

The equation summarizing this process is:

$$
h \nu = \phi + K
\quad \Rightarrow \quad K = h \nu - \phi
$$

This equation was **experimentally verified** by Robert Millikan between 1905 and 1915 ‚Äî ironically, he had set out to disprove Einstein but ended up confirming his theory with remarkable precision.

**Figure ‚Äî The Photoelectric Effect explained by Einstein (1905):**  
Light shines on a metallic surface as photons, each carrying energy $E = h\nu$. When the photon‚Äôs energy exceeds the work function $\phi$, an electron is ejected with kinetic energy $K = h\nu - \phi$. This phenomenon confirms the particle-like nature of light.

### üèÖ Recognition and Impact

Einstein was awarded the **1921 Nobel Prize in Physics** ‚Äî **not** for his theory of relativity, but **for his explanation of the photoelectric effect**. His proposal consolidated the idea that light has a **dual nature**: sometimes behaving as a wave, sometimes as a particle.

This discovery paved the way for the entire **formulation of modern quantum mechanics**, showing that **quantization applied not only to matter ‚Äî but also to radiation itself**.

:::

The emission spectrum of hydrogen displayed sharp, well-defined lines, as if electrons could only occupy specific energy levels.

‚û°Ô∏è In 1913, **Niels Bohr** proposed a radical atomic model for the time. According to him, electrons:

- Orbit the nucleus only in permitted orbits, with **quantized** energies;  
- Emit or absorb light only when **jumping** between these levels.  

With this, Bohr could explain the hydrogen spectrum: the emitted photons have an energy determined by the difference between levels:

$$
\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = h\nu
$$

üìå His proposal directly connected the concept of **quantization** to the structure of the atom ‚Äî a major blow to the continuous foundations of classical physics.

## üß® A System in Crisis

The phenomena analyzed so far ‚Äî blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, and atomic spectra ‚Äî pushed classical physics against the wall:

- Light behaved like a **particle**;  
- Energy was emitted and absorbed in **discrete quantities**;  
- Atoms displayed **quantized structures**, not continuous ones.  

These results could no longer be ignored.

üß© The consistency between these ideas and experiments was undeniable ‚Äî a **new description of reality** was emerging.

::: {.callout-note icon="üî≠" title="The 20th Century Demanded a New Theory"}
This new theory would appear in **1925**, breaking with centuries of classical intuition.

With decisive contributions from **Heisenberg**, **Schr√∂dinger**, **Born**, **Dirac**, and others, **Quantum Mechanics** was born ‚Äî a scientific revolution comparable to those of **Copernicus** or **Newton**.

With it, understanding the atom came to mean **rethinking the very nature of reality**.
:::

## üîö Conclusion of Part 1 ‚Äî The Limits of Classical Physics

At the end of the 19th century, physics seemed complete ‚Äî but the phenomena of blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, and atomic spectra exposed deep cracks in classical theory.

Each of these phenomena revealed something the established physics could not explain:

- Thermal radiation required a new way to distribute energy;  
- Light appeared to behave like a particle, not only as a wave;  
- The structure of atoms was not continuous, but quantized.  

These challenges opened the path to a new way of thinking ‚Äî a conceptual revolution that demanded abandoning old certainties.

> The microscopic reality revealed its own rules, and understanding the atomic world would require **new mathematical tools, new principles, and a new physics**.
