# 🧭 📚 🌠 Reading Guide — General Relativity Series

> _Explore step by step one of the most revolutionary theories of Physics._

---

## 📘 Introduction

The Theory of General Relativity, formulated by **Albert Einstein in 1915**, replaced the classical notion of gravity as a force with a profound view: **gravity is the curvature of spacetime** caused by the presence of mass and energy.

This series of posts presents the essential concepts of this theory in a progressive way, with a didactic focus and accessible language.

Currently, only **Part 1** is available. The next parts will be published soon.

# ⏳ 📚 🌠 Coming Soon

- **📚 🌠 Part 2 — Gravity as Curvature of Spacetime**
- **📚 🌠 Part 3 — Einstein’s Equations**
- **📚 🌠 Part 4 — Experimental and Observational Tests**
- **📚 🌠 Part 5 — Limits and Boundaries of the Theory**
- **📚 🌠 Part 6 — Legacy, Applications, and the Future**
